ðŸ‘‹ Hey,

I am Keenan and I am a primarily self-taught autistic R Data Scientist :mage: with a Systems Engineering (non-software) background. 

My interests pertaining to Data Science are Natural Language Programming and really any interesting data problem that can help people out.

My preferred language is R, but I am fluent in Python and am curious about Rust, C, and Julia.

I am drawn to the systemic questions that Data Science can help grant insight into. Mainly history, politics, religion, and economics. Answering the "why" question is a part of my internal programming. 

I am currently:

- :student: Finishing up my Master's Degree
- :classical_building: Developing a Political Sentiment Lexicon
- :technologist: Seeking Employment Opportunities in the Data Science space

I don't really do social media for mental health reasons and I have far too many interests for my own good.
