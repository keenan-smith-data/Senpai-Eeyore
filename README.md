ðŸ‘‹ Hey,

I am Keenan and I am a primarily self-taught autistic R Data Scientist :mage: with a Systems/Mechanical Engineering (non-software) background. 

My interests pertaining to Data Science are Natural Language and Data Products that Inform

My preferred language is R/SAS, but I can get around reasonably in Python and am actively, albeit slowly, learning Rust and C.

I am naturally drawn to looking at systems and how they relate to one another. I am interested in how data measures life compared to lived experience.  

I am currently:

- ðŸ“Š Employed as a Public Sector Data Analyst
- ðŸ§  Always Trying to Learn more about Programming 

I don't have social media though maybe I will have a blog one day even if its just for me.
